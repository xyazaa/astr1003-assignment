Theories which attempt to describe the fate of the universe partly rely on the properties of 
gravity, the overall geometry of the universe, and dark energy.

The geometry of the universe is determined by its density (average matter) compared to a critical density. 
This critial density is proportional to the Hubble Constant and tells us if the average matter in the universe can
simply halt the expansion in an infinite amount of time. If the density is greater than the critical density, then
the geometry of space is closed and positively closed (alike a sphere). If the density is equal to the critical density, then
the geometry of the universe is flat, alike a sheet of paper, and infinite in extent. If density is less than
critical density, then the geometry of space is open, and negetively closed (alike a saddle like shape).

Currently the universe is expanding according to the Hubble Constant, and seems to be accelarating instead of 
decreasing from gravity due to a unknown force called dark energy. Scientist currently don't know exactly 
what is dark energy, but they do know it exists and it is the something which is speeding up expansion. There are 
two main explanation for dark energy:
Vacuum energy
A fundamental, ever-present background energy called vacuum energy, which could be equal to the cosmological constant,
a mathematical term in Einstein's equations in the Theory of General Relativity. It is a vacuum energy of empty 
space which was used to keep the universe static rather than contracting or expanding according to his equation. 
However, once Hubble observed that the universe was expanding, he quickly removed this constant. If this is dark
energy is equal to this 'cosmological constant' then dark energy would not only balance gravity but exude a negetive
pressure which then causes the expansion of the universe.
Quintessence
Nicknamed Quintessence after the proposed mysterious fifth element proposed by the ancient Greeks. 
This energy could be a sort of energy fluid or field which fills space and behaves in a opposite way to normal 
matter and can vary in amounts and distributions in space and time.

If the universe is closed, then there are two possibilies. If the universe has a lot of dark
energy, then expansion could continue forever. However, if the universe lacks the repulsive force of dark energy 
then gravity will eventually stop the expansion, and start to contract untill all matter collapses into a 
singularity.

If the universe is open or even flat, the universe will continue expand because gravity alone will not be sufficient to
stop the expansion.

These situations give 4 main possible states to the end of the universe.

Big Freeze
In the case that the universe continues to expand forever, galaxies will continue to seperate and star formation
within the galaxies will ceases as there is not enough material to form new stars. Then the universe will
eventually cool down to absolute zero, a heat death will occur. In this state, no life will be able to exist.

Big Crunch
The universe will begin to contract, and continue into a singularity point. Eventually, the universe will enter a 
fireball state like the state which the Big Bang originated from. This gives form to the "Oscillating Theory 
of the Universe", where the universe contracts and expands in a cyclic way.

Big Rip
This occurs if dark energy continues to cause the accelarating expansion of the universe without limit, then
dark energy could become so strong and overwhelm the other fundamental forces. This will cause galaxies to pull 
apart, then stars, then atoms themselves.

Big Bounce
Derived from the Big Crunch and Big Bang theory, it predicts if the Big Crunch compacts the universe to a 
singularity, another Big Bang could occur in which another universe will emerge. This means that we could currently
live in a series of universes.

From recent research, the probability of the Big Crunch and Big Bounce theory has become negliable. Current 
research from WMAP satellites and Cosmic Background Imager indicate that the universe has a flat shape, giving 
favour to the theory of the Big Freeze.

"I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space" - Lord Byron
